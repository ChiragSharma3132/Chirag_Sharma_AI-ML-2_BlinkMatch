 📝 Short Project Description

**BlinkMatch** is an AI-powered facial recognition system that enhances security through liveness detection using **blink verification**.  
Built using Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit, the system ensures that only **real, live individuals** can unlock access, effectively preventing spoofing via images or videos.  
The system can be used in **secure access control**, **healthcare identity verification**, and **retail automation**.
